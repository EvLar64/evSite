          Francis Ford Coppola is an American filmmaker born in Detroit, Michigan in 1939. Thanks to some of his classic films (like <strong>The Godfather</strong> and <strong>Apocalypse Now</strong>), he is widely considered to be a major contributor to the emergence of the <strong>New Hollywood</strong> movement. He's won five Academy Awards (for direction, best picture, and various screenplays), and except for this new movie, has been dormant from the cinema scene - instead focusing largely on growing his wine company. His career collaborations have not only impacted his own legacy, but the greater climate of movies in general. Such collaborations include the likes of: George Lucas, Marlon Brando, Martin Scorsese, and Woody Allen. He even has other famous family members in the industry, like Nicolas Cage (<strong>Raising Arizona</strong>, <strong>National Treasure</strong>), Talia Shire (<strong>The Godfather</strong>, <strong>Rocky</strong>), and his own director daugther, Sofia Coppola (<strong>Marie Antoinette</strong>, <strong>Lost in Translation</strong>).  </p>
