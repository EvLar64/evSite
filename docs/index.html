        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="background-color: #87F7FD; text-indent:5em; padding: 1.2em">I was born and raised in southern California. I lived with my parents and brother there until graudating high school and moving to Idaho for almost a year, and then finally to Pennsylvania for college. I've been working (in either education or video) and going to school here ever since.
            As for what I like, I play the guitar and bass (and have been since age 8), I play golf, and sometimes I write in my spare time. In addition, I'm a big movie fan and would like to find some kind of career in that industry (and Daryl Hannah signed my Kill Bill poster).</p>
