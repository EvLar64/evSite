        <h2><p style="background-color: #87F7FD>About Me</p></h2>
        <p style="background-color: #87F7FD; text-indent:5em; padding: 1.2em">I was born and raised in the town of Quartz Hill, California. I lived there with my parents and brother until graduating high school; I then moved to Idaho (lived there for about a year), and then finally to Pennsylvania for college. Since then, I've been going to school and working here (originally a Math major/Online math tutor, now a DIGIT major/video editor).
            As for hobbies, I play the guitar and bass (and have been since age 8), I play golf, and sometimes I write in my spare time. In addition, I'm a big movie fan and would like to find some kind of career in that industry (and Daryl Hannah signed my Kill Bill poster).</p>
