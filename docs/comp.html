        <h2>Which Method is Best?</h2>
        <p style="background-color: #87b8f5; text-indent:5em; padding: 1.2em">When it comes to building a site using <u>HTML versus with WordPress</u>, I'd say I generally prefer using standard HTML. Both methods have their benefits and drawbacks, however. With WordPress, it's much simpler to quickly put something together that looks decent out of the gate because of all the presets, themes, and the visual interface that you can directly interact with. But you don't necessarily get the full customization capabilities that you do when writing the HTML by hand. HTML <u>is</u> more time-consuming, and there is a fair learning curve for new learners (with learning syntax, functions, styling, and more), but there's a real sense of refinement that you don't get with the more ready-made construction of WordPress. Also, I felt more satisfaction in that process of starting with nothing and slowly building the site from there (as well as the instant feedback you get by refreshing HTML and immediately seeing what's changed). I guess I largely prefer HTML because it feels more like <u>I'm</u> responsible for the end result (whether good or bad). In terms of skills needed for each method, I'd say that HTML requires more memorization and repeated practice (just to get used to the various types of things you'll be doing regularly), whereas WordPress requires more of a stylistic eye since a lot of the baseline work is taken care of already.</p>
