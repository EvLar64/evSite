“Dear <people who="John Lennon" known="musician">John</people>,

We’ve never met but, of course, I’ve always enjoyed your work.

I am presently in the <location n="1">Philippines</location> <act>making “APOCALYPSE NOW”</act>. <timeframe>I’ve been here eight months, expect to be here another several months</timeframe>. I live inside a volcano, which is a jungle paradise, where there are beautiful mineral springs; and thought <question><typo correct="if">of</typo> ever you were in the Far East or if ever you would enjoy spending a little time talking about things in general and some distant future projects that I have in mind, please, I would love to cook dinner for you and just talk, listen to music and talk about movies.</question>

If coming to the Far East is difficult, then someday in the future, either in <location n="2">Los Angeles</location>, <location n="3">San Francisco</location> or <location n="4">New York</location>, I would like to meet you.

<closing>Sincerely,
Francis Coppola.</closing></letter>
