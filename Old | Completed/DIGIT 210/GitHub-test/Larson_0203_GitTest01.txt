GitHub Test: Part 1 - E.L.

The minstrel boy to the war is gone / In the ranks of death you will find him. His father's sword he hath girded on / And his wild harp slung behind him. Land of song, said the warrior bard / Tho' all the world betrays thee. One sword at least thy rights shall guard / One faithful harp shall praise thee.

- Sung by Chief O'Brien and Captain Maxwell
