  <shot close="true">CLOSE-UP. FERRIS</shot>

     An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA.
     His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat
     and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.</narr>

     <narr><char who="ferris">Ferris</char>' parents, <char who="tom">TOM</char> and <char who="katie">JOYCE BUELLER</char> are standing at

     Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed
     for work.</narr>

               Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.</d>

     <narr><char who="ferris">Ferris</char> exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can

               Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.</d>


     <narr>He starts to get up. <char who="katie">Joyce</char> gently pushes him back down.</narr>

               I have a test today. I have to take it.

               I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!</d>


     <narr>He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes.
     His older sister, <char who="jeanie">JEANIE</char>, walks into the room. She's dressed
     for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.</narr>

     <narr>She glares at <char who="ferris">Ferris</char>. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She
     slips out of the room. <char who="ferris">Ferris</char>' brother, <char who="cut">TODD</char> and sister,

               Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.</d>


     <narr>He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV

               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out

               My parents never allowed <char who="misc">Garth</char> over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But <char who="misc">Garth</char> isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for <char who="misc">Garth</char>. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard <char who="misc">Garth</char> crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from

               I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
               It's going to by very thick and very
               steamy. I think radio's a facinating
               medium, it challenges the imagination.

               broadcast voice. I practise it in the
               bathroom all the time. I used to play
               records and do introductions to them.
               But I've never had the chance to sit
               behind a microphone and try it out
               for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
               I'm going out to several million people
               so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant

               I had to work at Burger King to get the
