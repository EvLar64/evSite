FADE IN
<loc ext="true">EXT . SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN</loc>
<narr>A quiet, upper-middle class, North Shore Chicago suburb. A
Chevy Blazer cruises slowly down the street. Morning
papers are pitched out the window. A dog runs between the
houses. It's early autumn.</narr>
</scene>
<scene>
<loc ext="true">EXT. BAKER HOUSE</loc>
<narr>An attractive, old, three-story brick colonial. A news-
paper flies into frame, strikes the corner of the house and
drops into the bushes, a good twenty feet from the porch.
An alarm clock goes off with a jarring bzzzzz!</narr>
</scene>
    <scene>
<loc int="true">INT. HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY</loc>
<narr> The alarm continues for a beat. It stops and the house
explodes with activity as the Baker family wakes and
scrambles about their morning activities. There's <char who="jim">Jim
Baker</char>, midforties, father, insurance executive, tall, lean,
somewhat meek-looking, in his suit pants and handlebar
undershirt scurrying to the bathroom.</narr>
<d who="jim">JIM
Let's go! Chop, chop! We've got
relatives invading this afternoon!</d>
<narr>He slams the bathroom door. His wife, <char who="brenda">Brenda</char>, whips out of
the bedroom in her housecoat and heads down the stairs.
She's also in her midforties, strong, attractive and
dominant. <char who="mike">Mike Baker</char>, ten, wanders out of his bedroom,
scratching his rear end, yawning. He's young trouble,
preteen maniac boy.</narr>

into the bathroom and locks the door. <char who="sara">Sara</char> turns and marches into the bathroom at the other end of the hall.</narr>
<d who="mike">MIKE

<loc int="true">INT. HOUSE - THIRD FLOOR BEDROOM</loc>
<narr>It's a girl's bedroom done in antiques and frills. In
contrast to the mayhem on the first two floors, the third
floor is quiet and serene. A brilliant shaft of morning
sunlight shines down through a skylight above the brass
bed. The sheets and blankets are rumpled and kicked aside.
<char who="sam">Samantha Baker</char> stands before a floor mirror in the corner
of the room. Her back is to camera. A bath towel is
wrapped around her waist. She's staring at her body in the
mirror. She was up long before anyone else in the house
and has already showered. She puts a hand on her hip and
strikes a pose. She doesn't like it. She tries the other
hand. Both hands. She cocks her hip. Finally, she raises
both arms and strikes a Charles Atlas pose. She holds it
for a moment, then drops her arms. She groans.</narr>

<narr><shot close="true">CLOSEUP - <char who="sam">SAMANTHA</char>'S FACE</shot>
She's young and pretty. No seething, precocious sexuality.
Just a pretty, young girl. She's frowning. Obviously dis-
pleased with her looks.</narr>
<d who="sam">SAM
Chronologically, you're sixteen
today. Physically, you're still
fifteen.</d>
<narr>She lifts her damp hair off her face and neck and examines
the effect. She's not pleased.</narr>
<d who="sam">SAM
<desc>(drops

Worthless.</d>
<narr>She reaches down, out of frame, and comes up with a
telephone.</narr>
<d who="sam">SAM
<desc>(to the

I look exactly the same as I have
since summer.
Utterly forgettable.</d>

<desc>(pause, still
looking in
the mirror)</desc>
No, I didn't expect to wake up trans-
formed. I just thought that turning
sixteen is so major I'd wake up with
an improved mental state that would
show on my face. All that shows is
the fact that I don't have any tan
left.
<desc>(with a closing
sigh)</desc>
My family's probably pissed that I
haven't come down to let them wish
me 'Happy Birthday'. I'll see you
at school.</d>

Hi, <char who="sam">Sam</char>. Better hurry.</d>

in with a marking pen. An ancient mask in a plexi display
case, lit by a pin spot has cigarettes up its nose and a
slice of pizza on its forehead. A line of cigarettes have

pizza going around on the turntable. We move up to see the

hundred feet of tape is balled-up in the heads. On the
